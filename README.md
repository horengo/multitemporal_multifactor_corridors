# Repository for the generation of multitemporal multifactor corridor networks (M2CoNet)
The generation of M2CoNet requires several steps:
1. Generation of cost surfaces (for which the GEE code is provided)
2. Generation of cost distance rasters from user-defined points using the knitghts move algorithm
3. Raster normalisation
4. Raster cells stats to join all distance rasters

While the GEE code is provided code for all other steps will be provided during the following weeks

## Generation of cost surfaces
The generation of cost surfaces requires two external datasets:
1. Maps of areas with loose sand surfaces (i.e. deserts). This was not generated by the same code as it requires a Mchine Learning multi-sensor approach that would have been too heavy for a single script.
   Consequently, the GEE code calls the resulting map from my GGE asset repository. The GEE code for the generation of this map has also been provided for reproducibility but it is not required to run the GEE code
   for the generation of cost surfaces
3. The Global Reservoir and Dam Database (GRanD), whcih can be downloaded at https://www.globaldamwatch.org/directory   Please, note that the GRanD has now been superseded by the The GDW (v1) consensus global database
   In order to use the database, please, download it from the provided link and upload in your GEE assets repository. Then provide the name of the asset in code line 99.
